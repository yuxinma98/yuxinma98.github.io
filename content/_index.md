Hi! I am a third year PhD student at the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) at Johns Hopkins University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Soledad Villar](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/villar/) and [Tim Kunisky](http://www.kunisky.com/). My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematics and deep learning. I aim to develop a better understanding of neural networks using a variety of mathematical tools, while also investigate how deep learning can aid in solving challenging mathematical problems. Check out the [about me](https://yuxinma98.github.io/about/) page to learn more!

Previously, I completed an [MMath and BA Hons degree in Mathematics](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/undergrad) at the University of Cambridge where I was mentored by [Benedikt Löwe](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/loewe/) and [Orsola Rath Spivack](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/or100/). During my master's studies, I focused on statistics and completed an [essay](https://1drv.ms/b/c/e03f4172bb13adf9/EfmtE7tyQT8ggOCNmQAAAAABhfVBbB6fDku2oiO60cYQzw) on Topological Data Analysis, advised by [John Aston](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~jada2/) and [Jacob Rasmussen](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~jar60/).
