keywords:
  - principal component analysis
  - random matrix theory
  - spiked matrix models
  - low-rank estimation
tldr: "We study a new class of spectral algorithms for low-rank estimation that involve a tunable nonlinear deformation of an observed matrix. The tunable component can be selected using methods such as black-box optimization or learned from data using neural networks."
