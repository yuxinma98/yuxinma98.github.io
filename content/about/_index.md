## My background

I was born and raised in Nanjing, China. My journey has taken me to Singapore and Cambridge, UK, where I had the privilege of living and studying before embarking on my PhD in Baltimore, USA.

During my undergraduate studies, I spent four years doing the [Mathematical Tripos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/undergrad), which introduced me to a diverse range of mathematical areas. I developed a passion for two distinct directions: the rigorous study of **abstract structures** (with abstract algebra, geometry, topology, and category theory as my favorites) and the practical modeling of **real-world data** (involving statistics and machine learning). The convergence of these interests inspired me to explore interdisciplinary realms, as I came to believe that the deepest human wisdom lies in the underlying connections and shared insights across different topics.

<!-- In my fourth year at Cambridge, I was introduced to the field of **Geometric Deep Learning** through [Prof. Michael Bronstein's illuminating talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6Pw4MOzMuo). This area, precisely at the intersection of my interests, captivated me with its expansive mathematical theories and exciting applications propelling advancements in artificial intelligence. Intrigued by the possibilities it presented, I decided to pursue a PhD to delve deeper into this area. I was very fortunate to have joined Soledad's group at JHU, and I am now relishing every moment of my time here! -->
