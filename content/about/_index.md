title: "About me"
---
I was born and raised in Nanjing, China. My journey has since taken me to Singapore and Cambridge, UK, where I had the privilege of living and studying before beginning my PhD in Baltimore, USA. During my undergraduate years studying mathematics, I developed a passion for two distinct directions: the rigorous study of **abstract structures** --- with abstract algebra, geometry, topology, and category theory among my favorites --- and the practical modeling of **real-world data**, involving statistics and machine learning. The convergence of these interests led me to explore interdisciplinary realms, as I found it particularly exciting to discover hidden connections and shared insights across seemingly different domains. I was then intrigued by the new research are of **Geometric Deep Learning** which is exactly at  the intersection of my interests, and I decided to pursue a PhD to explore more. In the research journey, I'm simultaneously enjoying first the happiness of gradually discover what's going on in these black-box models, like a scientist; on the other hand, i secretly uses the research as an excuse to continually learn and explore new mathematics.
<!-- In my fourth year at Cambridge, I was introduced to the field of **Geometric Deep Learning** through [Prof. Michael Bronstein's illuminating talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6Pw4MOzMuo). This area, precisely at the intersection of my interests, captivated me with its expansive mathematical theories and exciting applications propelling advancements in artificial intelligence. Intrigued by the possibilities it presented, I decided to pursue a PhD to delve deeper into this area. I was very fortunate to have joined Soledad's group at JHU, and I am now relishing every moment of my time here! -->

## Resesarch interests
I am broadly interested in mathematically unraveling the interplay between the **structure** of data (e.g., symmetries, distributions, and geometric properties) and the neural networks that process them. By understanding why and when these models excel, I aim to improve existing models and design new ones, guided by mathematical foundations. Below, I outline some research questions I am currently exploring and am passionate about. If you share an interest in these topics, I would be delighted to connect.

* **Any-dimensional Learning and Size Generalization**: While architectures like transformers, graph neural networks (GNNs), and DeepSets are designed to handle inputs of varying sizes with fixed-size learnable weights, their ability to generalize across sizes---for instance, training on smaller instances and performing well on larger ones---remains poorly understood. I seek to answer two fundamental questions:

    1. For existing any-dimensional models (i.e., those capable of handling inputs of arbitrary sizes), what properties of the **data** and **task** enable effective size generalization?
        * This is a question of the model's implicit inductive bias. Checkout our recent paper [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23599) and my talk [[3]](https://yuxinma98.github.io/talks/2025_size_generalization/).
    2. For an any-dimensional learning task involving data of varying sizes, how can we design new architectures or modify existing ones to achieve effective size generalization?
        * I am particularly interested in the concept of "learning an algorithm" that works across **all input dimensions**. Check our our recent work in this direction [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12528).

* **Symmetries in Machine Learning**
Learning problems that I am passionate about --- such as "learning an algorithm" --- usually involve **symmetries**. This has drawn me to the area of **equivariant machine learning**, where neural network designs explicitly incorporate symmetry constraints inherent to the data or task. Meanwhile, it appears that in order for a model to use fixed learnable weights to parametrize a function capable of processing inputs of arbitrary dimensions, symmetry constraint is almost always required. This is closely related to the concept of **representation stability**.

* **Training dynamics and weight space structure**
More recently, I have been intrigued by the study of **training dynamics**, focusing on understanding how the function parametrized by a neural network evolves throughout the training process, under the random initialization. Specifically, I am exploring how the weight space structure interacts with the $\mu$P (maximal update parametrization) framework, which has proven to be a powerful tool for scaling neural networks effectively.
